## Quick Start

### Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Python 3.12+ installed
- [ ] Docker installed and running
- [ ] llama.cpp built (need `llama-server` binary)
- [ ] GGUF model downloaded (recommend: `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf`)
- [ ] ~4 GB free VRAM (GPU) or ~8 GB free RAM (CPU-only)

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/flexcreates/ENML.git
cd ENML

# 2. Run automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Edit .env with your paths
nano .env
# Set MODEL_PATH and LLAMA_SERVER to your actual locations
```

### Starting ENML

Open **three terminals** in the ENML directory:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the vector database
./run_qdrant.sh

# Terminal 2: Start the LLM server
./run_server.sh

# Terminal 3: Start the chat
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 chat.py
```

You should see:
```
Initializing ENML Orchestrator...
--- Chat Started (Session: session_20260222_190000) ---
Type 'exit' to quit, '/remember <text>' to save a fact.

You: _
```

## Teaching Facts to Your AI

ENML learns automatically from natural conversation. Simply tell it things:

### Identity Information
```
You: my name is Flex
You: I'm a software engineer
You: I'm 25 years old
```

### System Specs
```
You: my PC is a Lenovo LOQ with i5-12450HX and RTX 3050
You: I have 16GB of RAM
You: I'm running Ubuntu 24.04
```

### Interests and Hobbies
```
You: I like vibe coding and creating art
You: I enjoy playing chess
You: I love watching sci-fi movies
```
> Interests/hobbies stack — saying "I like chess" won't overwrite "I like vibe coding".

### Relationships
```
You: my father's name is John
You: my best friend is Alex
You: I have a dog named Bruno
```

### Force-Saving Facts
If you want to explicitly save something without relying on automatic extraction:
```
You: /remember I have a medical condition called ADHD
✅ Memory saved: 'I have a medical condition called ADHD'
```

### What NOT to Do
- Don't phrase facts as questions: `"what is my name?"` will NOT be saved as a fact
- Don't expect the AI to learn from its own responses — only **your** messages are extracted

---

## Recalling Information

Simply ask the AI about things you've told it:

```
You: what is my name?
AI: Your name is Flex.

You: what are my PC specs?
AI: You have a Lenovo LOQ with an i5-12450HX processor and RTX 3050 GPU.

You: what are my hobbies?
AI: You enjoy vibe coding and creating art.
```

### How It Works
1. Your question is routed to the `knowledge_collection` (identity queries) or `research_collection` (factual queries)
2. The top matching facts are retrieved and injected into the system prompt
3. The AI is instructed to answer ONLY from the retrieved facts
4. If no relevant fact exists, the AI will say "I don't know" instead of guessing

---

## Session Management

### Automatic Session Saving
When you type `exit`, the current session is automatically saved to:
```
memory/conversations/YYYY/MM/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Resuming a Session
```bash
python3 chat.py --session session_20260222_184853
```
This loads the previous conversation history, so the AI has the full context.

### Finding Session IDs
Sessions are named with timestamps. Check your conversations directory:
```bash
ls memory/conversations/2026/02/
```

---

## Ingesting External Data

### Conversation Logs
Import a previously saved conversation into the vector database for long-term retrieval:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 ingest_conversation.py memory/conversations/2026/02/session_xyz.json --importance 0.8
```

### Code Files
Make your AI aware of a codebase:
```bash
python3 ingest_project.py /path/to/project/main.py --module "MyProject" --language python
python3 ingest_project.py /path/to/project/utils.py --module "MyProject" --language python
```

Then ask coding questions:
```
You: what functions are in the MyProject module?
AI: Based on the ingested code, ...
```

### Research Documents
Ingest a text file (article, paper, documentation):
```bash
python3 ingest_research.py /path/to/paper.txt --topic "transformer architecture"
```

Then query it:
```
You: explain the transformer architecture
AI: Based on the research material, ...
```

### Web Pages
Use the WebIngestor programmatically:
```python
from research.web_ingestor import WebIngestor
from core.vector.retriever import Retriever

ingestor = WebIngestor(retriever=Retriever())
ingestor.ingest_url("https://example.com/article", topic="AI safety")
```

## System Management

### Running Diagnostics
```bash
python3 chat.py --diagnose
```
Tests: JSON parsing, Entity Linker versioning/contradiction detection.

### Checking Qdrant Status
Visit `http://localhost:6333/dashboard` in your browser to inspect collections, point counts, and storage.

### Viewing Logs
```bash
# Human-readable log
tail -f logs/memory_system.log

# Structured JSON audit trail
tail -f logs/audit.jsonl
```

### Full System Reset
```bash
chmod +x reset_memory.sh
./reset_memory.sh
```
> ⚠️ This permanently deletes ALL memory, sessions, profile data, and Qdrant collections.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" on chat startup
**Cause:** Qdrant or llama-server not running.
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Qdrant
curl http://localhost:6333/health
# If it fails: ./run_qdrant.sh

# Check llama-server
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# If it fails: ./run_server.sh
```

### AI says "I don't know" for things you told it
**Possible causes:**
1. **Extraction failed** — check `logs/memory_system.log` for `❌ Rejected` lines
2. **Low confidence** — the LLM may have given a confidence below the threshold
3. **Wrong routing** — the query may be going to the wrong collection

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check what's stored in Qdrant
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "
from core.vector.retriever import Retriever
r = Retriever()
results = r.search('knowledge_collection', 'user name', limit=10)
for res in results:
    print(res['payload'])
"
```

### AI hallucinating its own identity
**Cause:** Authority memory not properly loaded.
**Fix:** Check `memory/authority/profile.json` and verify `AI_NAME` in `.env`.

### Out of memory / slow responses
**Causes:**
- VRAM exhausted — reduce `-ngl` layers in `run_server.sh`
- Context too large — the system auto-trims, but very long sessions can be heavy
- Embedding model loading — first run downloads ~90 MB model (cached afterward)

### Docker permission errors
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and log back in
```
